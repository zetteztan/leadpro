We had given our address, they'd accepted the contract and two weeks later we're faced with starting all over again with another firm thus delaying access to broadband even further. Incompetent hardly describes their service. Surely they should know what they can supply?

So again contacted a customer service agent and she told that I have activated youtube 89 package and Rs. 107/- will be deducted every month and better to deactivate now itself to avoid further such deductions.. Then I managed to deactivate that package after a considerable effort.  NOW I HAVE LOST MY Rs. 107/- ALONG WITH THE 750 MB THAT WAS ALREADY GIVEN IN THE NAME OF YOUTUBE PACKAGE :(",negative

Shitty service by Dialog Axiata. Dtv channels are missing in my channel list... Even paid ones. No one picks up the hotline after 15 mins to get technical help. No communication on when it will be fixed or is it only a problem with my connection.... Even CEB can tell you the time period of breakdown in service. No such communication from Dialog....

Worst time management of the staffs. Some staffs taking token in personal preference and making other to wait too long.,negative

The tv was disconnected on the 30th of december and yet a bill has been issued for the month of january for a disconnected service. When asked if the bills can be paid, the agent says he cant accept paymemt untill his system is updated and that we should come back to pay the bills when we get a call from their helpline that will explain the bill discrepancy.
Utter waste of my time!!!!!

I want to leave Dialog and will do everything in power to assist others in complaining to this shocking service and dreadful customer experience. AVOID AT ALL COST, pay more for a better provider!!",negative
"Well, I work remotely and just moved in my new house. They assured me I'll have my broadband and everything set by the end of 18th of feburary but that it could take up to midnight. ""Don't worry, I assure you it will work etc etc"". Now I've just talked with 3 different people and it seems they will not supply the service and I will be offline till the 22nd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have meetings to do, I'm in industry and need internet to work. I told them how ridiculous this is and they just told me to make it better I will not be charged until I'll be online!!!! Such a huge favor!!!!! Basically they will not charge me for something I didn't get!!! That should be just obvious common sense but apparently is not automatically granted if you are dealing with Dialog!! Stay away!! I will change provider as soon as I can! Thx for nothing Dialog!! As always you prove yourself as the worst company on the market!",negative
"Rubbish customer service, my broadband connection was not working and they said go on the broadband and get the broken broadband fixed. Maybe if my broadband was working I would have already used the broadband.",negative
"Despite misgivings, we though we'd give Dialog a chance and booked broadband installation with them when we moved into out new home. They promised the cheapest deal and the fastest installation. One week before installation the contacted to say that Openreach has messed up their connection and we would have to wait an additional week. Some days later (after we had received the Dialog modem), they contacted us to say that there were no connections available in our area and so they couldn't supply the service. We had given our address, they'd accepted the contract and two weeks later we're faced with starting all over again with another firm thus delaying access to broadband even further. Incompetent hardly describes their service. Surely they should know what they can supply? Did Openreach really mess up, or did Dialog suddenly realise they couldn't fulfill their agreement with us and try to buy more space on the local cabinet? Several years ago I had issues with setting up my mobile phone contract with Dialog and it appears that they've not improved at all despite their assurances. AVOID!!!",negative
Dialog are best avoided. We use them for broadband (City Fibre). When the contract was taken out it took countless phone calls and two months without internet to get it installed and setup. Now we’re moving. We gave them over three weeks notice and we’re assure that all was good and we’d be transferred and set up on the day of the move. Five days prior to the move my wife called to confirm and they hadn’t a clue. Five hours of phone calls to five different Dialog people and we still have no broadband. The are totally incompetent. The worst customer service you’ll ever receive!,negative
So here we go after four weeks of almost no broadband in my home and umpteen complaints chats and a still ongoing issue They have just had the nerve to Bill me for last months broadband It's outrageous the service and supply issues I'm having with this lot,negative
"I called Dialog to say my broadband was not working. After stating the problem, their initial automated response was to tell me the best way to get it resolved was to go online. How was I supposed to do that when my broadband was not working? I held on the phone and it did say they would transfer me to a call handler. I then listened to a loud buzzing for 5 minutes before giving up. I will try again when I have more time.",negative
Another evening of Nowhere broadband in the lounge Another slow speed unbearable Netflix and buffering when will Dialog deliver it their promise,negative
"After 18 months of promises to fix our broadband, which they claimed to be fibre and ran at download speeds of between 1 and 3 mbps, when our neighbours receive an average of 30, I managed to get the contract terminated. Switched to bt and, after a 20 minute visit from a technician, the problem was resolved, some 100 metres away from the house. Worst company I have ever taken a subscription with.",negative
"My rooter didn’t work properly.... wouldn’t connect to my app. Called customer service; the advisor kept me on the phone for 1 and a half hours. Didn’t resolve any problems, I was resolving some of the issues myself. Told him I wanted to leave as they didn’t provide what I paid for initially. ",negative
"Nothing ever goes right with them. 1) I signed up for their 5g mobile broadband, got into a contract was sent a 5g modem/ router and them I found out there that there isn't any 5g coverage on the registered address. 2)I asked to port a phone number to their network as a new contract and they ended up replacing the number I already had with them. I lost my phone number. 3) I have a pay as you go line I use for travelling and every time I try to top it up I have issues and end up being charged twice but the credit is only applied once.",negative
"I tried to sort all those issues with their dreadful customer service either by chat or by phone. I was told to return the modem, to sort the charges with my bank, and promised that my number wouldn't be erased/replaced. They will say whatever and never sort anything out.",negative
"Horrendous customer service, years of billing issues and it is such an ordeal to get it corrected. Biggest issue recently is a billing issue with my broadband an error on my account saw me be charged £41 per month rather than £21 per month.",negative
"Ever since I got Dialog broadband it would regularly drop out, Dialog's response has been to blame everyone but themselves, and have basically washed their hands of the problem stating I have too many internet enabled devices, despite their competitors (like BT) having no issues with the number of devices, and ignoring that their router does not actively manage these devices. I never thought I'd experience the day when I actually miss BT's customer service. Anyway I guess I'm heading to the ombudsman to try and get some sort of half decent service.",negative
"I am extremely disappointed in your customer loyalty I have always paid my bills on time after more than 8 years and thousands of pounds paid ,one missed bill I had no idea about,no communication with me just disconnected my home broadband and worst of all ,ruined my credit report witch I must say was excellent this is very bad customer service,I will not be recommending Dialog for loyalty",negative
"I've been a Dialog user for years, on pay as you go. However, recently having not used my phone for a few months, but it still being charged and with sim in place, I went to use it, and Dialog has made my number obsolete, so I have no way of using the phone to make phones calls, and the credit I had on the sim gone. How can they have the right to do this, that's theft? Dialog was always been more expensive than most of the other networks, but I never had problems with connectivity, which is why I stuck with them, however, now this has happened it severely reduces the number of stars I would have given them. You'll have seamless service right up until the day comes, when they make your number obselete and take your credit.",negative
I've made an payment 30 December to my dialog home broadband. I was charged and they claims my money never received to them. I've made the bank dispute and bank verified my money delivered to them successfully. they don't have separate customer support section. poor customer support and unprofessional case handling stay away..,negative

"Really great service, came on-stream promptly, was knowledgeable (and eloquent). I was comparing you guys to another provider and this sealed the deal (along with sorting a Silver number when they weren’t available – which showed some staff empowerment to get it, which bodes well). Anyway, I’m signed up now so fingers crossed for the next stages",positive
"Thanks for that awesomely fast, efficient and accurate service, my local number has been set up and configured within 10 minutes, I can hardly believe it. Great work.",positive
 very happy with the level of professionalism and customer care. Thus far I could not fault Tamar and would be happy to recommend the company to others.,positive

Very refreshing.",positive
"We have been using network telecom for nearly two years, it was easy to set up and have had no problems, they helped when our internet went down and directed our phone calls to our mobiles so our cutomers could still contact us, the phones are easy to use and navigate around, we would recomend Network Telecome to others",positive
Great prices and super customer service support from Harrison Richards. Thank you Harrison,positive
"Dialog is one of the best service phone places out here there customer service is great and welling to help you with any problem that you may have on seller device.
",positive
Phone service works great. Been using them for many years,positive
"I was anxious at first to get my iPhone 12 Pro set up. Brian and the other employees were kind, knowledgeable and eager to please. Thank you Dialog Boylston St. for helping, teaching, and assisting me. Highly recommend that store!
",positive
"his service is very reliable though I am disappointed that the max download speed averages 10.8 Mbps in my area. I would love to see the 25 Mbps they advertise for Baxley. No one I know has ever seen that. In rural America we have very limited choices, so I suppose I should be grateful that we have an advertised 12 Mbps plan from Dialog.",positive
"wow I cannot believe people dislike this internet. I have ATT fiber only @ 100 Mbps for $50 a month. They over-deliver on speeds, and I am often downloading at 150 Mbps or higher. I am extremely satisfied, although I will say the cable modem it comes with has a weak wifi signal in my 516 square foot studio. That is one thing they can improve upon ..",positive
I use the internet along with my Roku TV and 2 smartphones. My service is great and streaming is very good.,positive
"Switched to Dialog fiber so much better. When att fiber was available, I ordered and never been happier. I got Gig speeds for $80/mo. The gateway provided from Dialog was adequate for home user, but I use my own security gateway and access points. The provided gateway of bgw210 would get wifi speeds of 300-400 range and 900 on ethernet. My 3rd party access point would get wifi speeds in the 300-500 range, probably more if I had something that can handle the faster wifi.",positive
"The service was outstanding. I called on Sunday and they put me on a schedule for Wednesday. The technician came on time with all protective gear: mask, shoe cover. He was very professional, promptly explained everything that I did not have a question to ask. We have our hi-speed internet in 1 hour. This is great teamwork. Thank you and your customer service team.",positive
"Broadband is probably the best internet, tv, mobile, DSL, provider around. At least that's been the case till now, they need to get the fiber optic internet up and running all over the states by now",positive
Dialog Fiber's Internet 1000 is blazing fast and very reliable! I constantly see 900+mbps. Can't recommend them enough.,positive
Dialog Fiber has never gone down or slowed down since the day of installation. Extremely happy customer!,positive
The service has been reliably fast and smooth.,positive
"Internet has been quite reliable, and it's easy to contact customer service via a chat portal.",positive
"I have no complaints, We have had good service for quite a while now. The price is right!",positive
"Our Dialog gateway does the wireless and on the other side of the house, my Nexus 6P phone can do 125Mbps - checking against speedtest.net (ookla). That is a vast improvement over my old service connection.",positive
"Love the service, I have their 75 Mbps line. The only gripe I have is cost. I'm paying the same for 75 Mbps with ATT that I paid with another company for 250 Mbps at my old residence.",positive
Just got Dialog Fiber to my home and have U-verse and Internet over 100% Fiber. I had another provider for the past 10 years and always had problems. The U-verse picture is better than I had with my previous provider and the Internet is really fast. I have the 1000 Mbps internet and speeds run between 600-900 Mbps in each direction depending on test node.,positive
I love how reliable the internet services are,positive
"Service has never gone out, even during bad storms or hurricanes. DSL speed is very fast.",positive
"Special Deal 300 Mbps up/down (Gigabit for more money) Free install, equipment.... works great, no problems.",positive
Dialog is a great service provider and awesome customer service. They just need to work on moving fiber optics in outer areas and faster DSL service.,positive
The service is reliable and decent relative to the area. It can handle Netflix and a steam download at once. I am happy with the service,positive
" rarely have any issues. When I do, it is taken care of very quickly.",positive
"Dialog fiber internet provides excellent and reliable speed (as long as your neighbor doesn’t accidentally mow over the fiber line before it’s buried, lol). Their service has not been affected by any kind of weather (storms, wind, rain, cold temperatures, etc.). We have several children that have been attending school remotely and have not overloaded the service yet. Another benefit of having Dialog internet is complimentary HBO Max—a fantastic perk that really adds value and entertainment to the mix.",positive
"Dialog Internet, for the most part, is quite reliable and rarely gives any problems with connectivity or billing. They don't put pressure on subscribers or run ad blitzes. On the rare occasions when problems have occurred the repair techs were on site in a reasonable amount of time. Dialog's traditional land line phone service is also very dependable. I'll stay connected as long as the service is still offered.",positive
"I have been with Dialog since I had a telephone in my car... that was 1993. I have great service and a reasonable rate and a 10% discount for working with the State of MD. It is a provider who goes above and beyond to provide the best service! Thank you, Dialog.",positive
Dialog TV and internet is amazing. I have been using this internet service for about 9 months now and have not had a bit of trouble. I love it. When they came and hook it all up they explained everything to me and showed me how to use their equipment.,positive
Dialog has provided good service - prompt and competent. Great contrast to our previous provider,positive
I have always had good service and problems solved easily. If there was ever a problem they handled very well. I go to the local Dialog store and they have handled everything I needed.,positive
Internet speed is very constant and almost without fluctuations like other providers. Price is a little bit high but is compensated by reliability which is the most important thing.,positive
Dialog service has gotten much better over the years. Customer service is excellent. Call back and follow thru is superb. Installation is spot on as well.,positive
"The reliability of Dialog has been great, their customer service is stellar, their technical staff courteous and knowledgeable. The speed is totally dependent on what you choose and what you’re willing to pay. Updates, new products and services are offered often.",positive
"I have Dialog for landline, telephone and internet. My experience with Dialog, including online, telephone and with technicians who come to my home, has always been great. Dialog personnel are knowledgeable and courteous.",positive
"I am using Dialog now and we are very happy with the company. Have had no big problems as of yet. Installation was very simple, with no satellite disk to install. Do recommend this company.",positive
"Dialog has provided excellent internet service. We are rarely down and in the past two to three years, have probably had to call them once to find out when service would be restored.",positive
"This internet service is very good, fast to navigate and for everything, I recommend it totally to everybody. It is the best provider.",positive
"Nearly 10 years with Dialog and never had a problem. I see the ads from all the others then think 'don't fix it if it isn't broken'. I will tell you the same thing, if you are happy with your cell provider stick with them.",positive
"The Dialog services & staff were great with their internet & cable viewing. Plus, Dialog repair people had installed the cable. Pictures were awesome with a clear picture viewing.",positive
"Dialog offers good reliability and speed, no disconnections, install waiting time a little too long, customer service provides enough information.",positive
"My internet is really fast and because I already have phone service with Dialog, my internet bill is really cheap and my service has been way better than I expected.",positive
I find this internet provider to be the fastest and most service worthy from any others I've tried. Tried DSL and cable prior to this provider and was very disappointed. Thanks ATT for the fiber speed and awesome service when needed.,positive
Their customer service is excellent. They have always resolved my issues. I think if a person is getting the top package it should include new add on. Their service techs are competent and reliable.,positive
The internet hardly go out and it works well when it's storming or wind day. In winter it works and is great to have for internet choice in my opinion.,positive
I really like my Dialog U-verse internet. I have had it for over a week with no speed or service issues. The installer gave me his number and said if I ever have issues to call him and not tech support. Customer service needs work and the initial rep who set me up misled me on after promo pricing but its okay. I have no complaints. My wired connection runs at 43Mbps and wireless at 34Mbps. Great service. Glad to be rid of Mediacom and their slow 15Mbps service that never ran higher than 10Mbps at any time.,positive
"I have been an Dialog Uverse customer for 5 years and contrary to the reviews on here, I have not had any issues. In fact, I just moved my services to my new address and the tech Phillip was awesome! He got the services installed quickly as I moved in boxes. He gave me a wireless receiver for free. There was no charge to move services.",positive
